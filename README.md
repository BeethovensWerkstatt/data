# data
This repository is supposed to hold the data for Beethovens Werkstatt, starting
with module 3 onwards

Each module will receive a separate folder inside the /data path. Within the
/exist folder, an eXist application will be build up, which is supposed to serve
the data through a REST api, using the following (preliminary) paths:

* /module1 -> /var
* /module2 -> /arr
* /module3 -> /corr
* /module4 -> /sk
* /module5 -> /ed
